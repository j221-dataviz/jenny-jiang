 I [searched the archive](https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/home.htm#ECOPRO) but didn't find the dataset. However, I was able to get 2008, 2009, 2010-2011, 2012-2013, 2014-2015 (they changed the method to combine two years together) using wayback machine.

I found [similar dataset on this page](https://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_education_training_system.htm) 
- Earnings and unemployment rates by educational attainment
- Educational attainment for workers 25 years and older by detailed occupation
- Education and training assignments by detailed occupation, 2014
- Employment, wages, and projected change in employment by typical entry-level education


I plan to use wayback machine to trace down these datasets, so I will be able to get information about educational attainment, earnings by detailed occupation. Though I couldn't do a long-term time series comparison, at least I have 5 different time points.
